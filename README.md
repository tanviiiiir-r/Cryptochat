# 🔐 Cryptochat – Secure Messaging App (macOS, Python, PyQt5)

**Cryptochat** is a standalone macOS secure messaging application built with **Python** and **PyQt5**, designed with real-world cryptographic principles. It demonstrates hybrid encryption, GUI-based communication, message expiry, and secure self-destruction — all packed into a native `.app`.

> 🧠 Built as a portfolio project for Erasmus+ and cybersecurity career development.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-128 + RSA-2048 hybrid model
* 🧪 **Integrity Protection**: HMAC-SHA256
* ⏳ **Self-Destructing Messages**: Based on timer or first read
* 🖥️ **Standalone GUI App**: No terminal or dependencies needed
* 💥 **Read-Once Mode**: Deletes messages after viewing
* 🍏 **Packaged for macOS** via PyInstaller

## 🧠 Installation (macOS App)

1. Download the latest `.app` release from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/cryptochat/releases)
2. Move it to your `/Applications` folder
3. Double-click to launch

> Note: If Gatekeeper blocks it, right-click → "Open" → "Allow Anyway" in **System Preferences > Security**.

## 🔡️ Cryptographic Architecture

| Component       | Technology Used                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Encryption      | AES-128 (EAX mode)                  |
| Key Exchange    | RSA-2048                            |
| Integrity Check | HMAC-SHA256                         |
| Key Storage     | `rsa_public.pem`, `rsa_private.pem` |

Each message is:

* Encrypted with a **random AES key**
* AES key is encrypted with **recipient’s RSA public key**
* HMAC is generated for message integrity
* Metadata includes expiry and read-once flags
